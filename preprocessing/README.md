# Preprocessing of EEG data in FieldTrip

This preprocessing/ directory is the location of code and script that is intended to preprocess the EEG data before
subsequent pairwise conditional Granger causality is performed with the src/MVGC/ toolbox, and the later discovery of 
emergent macroscopic variables across all scales using the src/ssdi toolbox.
